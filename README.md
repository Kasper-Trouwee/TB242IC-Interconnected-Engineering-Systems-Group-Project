# How To Run
Open two terminals/cmd. In the firs terminal you follow the steps of *Server* and in the second terminal you follow the steps of *Client*.
> You should always do *Server* first since if the *Client* can't find a server it will crash.
## Server
1. `cd server`
2. `python server.py`
## Client
1. `cd client`
2. `python client.py`

> It could be that you need to use `python3` instead of `python`
